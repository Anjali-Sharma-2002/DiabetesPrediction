This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using eight key health indicators, including pregnancy history, glucose levels, insulin, blood pressure, skin thickness, and age.

There are three different models for classification: SVM Classifier, Logistic Regression and SGD Classifer.
Model results using f1 score for cross validation predictions and test dataset.


F1 score                     |   Cross-validation prediction  |  Test Dataset
SVM Model                    |           0.65                 |       0.54
Logistic Regression Model    |           0.64                 |       0.53
SGD Classifier Model         |           0.60                 |       0.45
